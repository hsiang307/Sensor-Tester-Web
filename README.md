Accessing the Web Interface
-------------------

This application uses a web interface to allow the user to interact with Tibbo *Cable Probe Sensors*. In order to access the web interface, we must first know the IP address which has been assigned to the device. After loading the application to the device, open *Device Explorer* and take note of the IP address displayed next to the application. Then, navigate to that IP address using a web browser of your choosing.



## Main Screen

If a sensor is connected, the following will be displayed:

If no sensor is connected, a prompt to connect a sensor will be displayed.



Sensors can be plugged an unplugged while the application is still running.
